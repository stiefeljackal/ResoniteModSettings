# ResoniteModSettings

**Note:** _Since an official mod loader is not in place, this one will link to the mod loader created by Rucio and Stiefel. Once an official one comes out (perhaps a collab between all forks), then we will replace the URL below._

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/bontebok/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/). Adds a dash screen to edit mod configs

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/bontebok/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place ResoniteModSettings.dll into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
